<h1>InOutBoard</h1>

<p>The InOutBoard is a simple tool for any group which want to know if someone is available. At every desk you can create a client and connect
to the server. This may help to reduce the numbers of unanswered calls.</p>
<p>Not many features are implemented by now. This is rather an excerise than a product. Therefore no warranties or else are given.</p>
<p>This is the repository that contains the server source files for the InOutBoard. You can find the code for the clients <a href="https://github.com/kabcode/Client_IOB">here</a>.</p>
